# Browser Tag

Sample that shows how to use the [browser tag](http://developer.chrome.com/trunk/apps/app_external.html#browsertag)
in an app to create a mini browser.

The app's main window contains a `<browser>` that is sized to fit most of it
(via the `width` and `height` attributes). The location bar is used to
update its `src` attribute.

The browser is the preferred way for you to load web content into your app. It
runs in a separate process and has its own storage, ensuring the security and
reliability of your application.
