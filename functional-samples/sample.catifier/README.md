When the extension is enabled, it replaces every image of extension jpg or jpeg, with [this](https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/8/23/S__rxG9hIUK4sNuMdTIY9w2.jpg) image.

## Testing the extension

1. Follow the instructions to load an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
2. Navigate to any website, you should see every jpg or jpeg image being replaced by an image of a cat.
