# Keyboard Handler Sample

This sample handles all keyboard events (preventing default behavior) and
maintains a dictionary of the state of each key.

It provides an easy way to check if the key strokes you are interested in can
be captured by a chrome packaged app, and learn what the appropriate keyCode
is for them.
