# Espruino LED toggle

This sample lets you toggle the state of an LED on an [Espruino JavaScript board](http://www.espruino.com) as well as reading back its current temperature. The board runs JavaScript, so it's easy to control it by sending JavaScript commands directly to it as strings.

1. Connect the Espruino Board
2. Install and launch this packaged app.
3. Make sure the drop-down box shows the correct serial device
4. Click `Connect`
3. Press the buttons to either toggle the state of an LED, flash it 3 times, or read back the chip's current temperature.
