# Arduino LED toggle

Note: on Mac OS X Lion, it's necessary to update USB Serial drivers:

This sample shows a big button that lets you toggle between the on/off
state of an LED connected to an Arduino.

1. Install the LED sketch on your Duo.
2. Attach a LED to pin 2 (with a resistor to not burn it out).
3. Install and launch this packaged app.
4. Press the button to toggle the LED.

Future version: use the standard Firmata sketch and build a JS firmata driver
for Chrome packaged apps.
