# Chrome Commando TCP server

This is a sample that shows how you can run a network TCP server in a packaged app. This sample allows you to start a server in an arbitrary address and port. Telnet to the listening port and you will be able to remotely control your browser by sending some commands such as `open` and `echo`.
