# Rich notifications

This sample shows how to use the "templated" notifications API,
aka Rich Notifications, which allows an app to show feature-rich notifications
in the system tray. This API is still in experimental state.


> WARNING: currently this API only works on ChromeOS and Windows. Linux should fail gracefully by displaying normal HTML5 notifications, but some info might not be presented on these platforms.
