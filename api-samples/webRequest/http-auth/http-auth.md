# webRequest.onAuthRequired

This sample demonstrates the use of the `webRequest.onAuthRequired` listener to detect an authentication request and log the user into designated site.

## Overview

When an authentication check is detected, a check is made to confirm that the request has come from the correct source. Account credentials are then provided for the response via an auth handler.
