# chrome.power

This extension demonstrates the `chrome.power` API by allowing users to override their system's power management features.

## Overview

The extension adds a popup that cycles different states when clicked. It will go though a mode that prevents the display from dimming or going to sleep, a mode that keeps the system awake but allows the screen to dim/go to sleep, and a mode that uses the system's default.

2. Load this directory in Chrome as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
