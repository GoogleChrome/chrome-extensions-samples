# chrome.tabCapture

A sample that demonstrates how to use the [`chrome.tabCapture`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabCapture/) API.

## Overview

In this sample, the `chrome.tabCapture` API captures the contents of the active tab. The captured stream is displayed in a new window.

## Implementation Notes

Use [`tabCapture.getMediaStreamId`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabCapture/#method-getMediaStreamId) to capture specific tabs.

The `targetTabId` and `consumerTabId` are obtained in the Service Worker, and then passed to the receiver page through the [`tabs.sendMessage`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-sendMessage) method.

See the [Audio recording and Screen capture guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/screen_capture/#audio-and-video) for a more detailed implementation.
