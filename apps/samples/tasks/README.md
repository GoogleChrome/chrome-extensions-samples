# Tasks app using GAPI

Demonstrates the usage of GAPI by listing user's Google Tasks. It can be either
used as a Chrome app, in which case the [GAPI Chrome Apps Lib](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/gapi-chrome-apps-lib)
is used, or as a web page, running on http://localhost:8000, taking advantage
of the [JavaScript Client Library](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/reference/referencedocs).
