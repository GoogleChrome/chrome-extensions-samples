label-printer-app
=================

Chrome packaged app for a simple label generator with printer support for Dymo 450 LabelWriter.

Code originally created by Marjin Kruisselbrink (@mkruisselbrink).

### Other printers

If you want to reuse this code for other LabelWriter printers, you might be able to do it if they use the same protocol.

For example, for Dymo 450 Turbo, you need to change:

- index.js
<pre>
var productId = 0x0021; // changed from 0x0020
</pre>

- manifest.json
<pre>
"optional_permissions": [ {"usbDevices": [{"vendorId": 2338, "productId": 33}]}] // changed from 32
</pre>

(thanks @kjantzer for the [information](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/issues/126#issuecomment-29547981))

### Windows issues

Some Windows device drivers take ownership of the device and don't allow Chrome to connect to them. If openDevice or findDevice doesn't work for you, you can try to use a generic low level driver instead.
