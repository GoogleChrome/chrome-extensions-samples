- Very simple IOIO client

- Tested with this hardware:
http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/06/15/new-product-ioio-mint-portable-android-development-kit/

- Constants/protocol taken from:
https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki/

Caveats:
- The bluetooth API is only available on Chrom(e|ium)OS
- Resource clean-up isn't happening properly yet: you will likely have to disable/enable bluetooth between runs of the program or the connection will fail
