# Code editor

A non-trivial sample with basic features of a code editor, like language detection and syntax highlight. If also uses the extended FileSystem API that allows a user to select files from the disk so the app can read and write to that file. This sample is very similar to the [mini-code-editor](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/mini-code-edit)
